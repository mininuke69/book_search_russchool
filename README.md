## how-to

1. paste a list of books into `big.txt`
2. run `basic_ol.py`
3. this will output a json file into `output_ol.json`
4. now run `human_readable.py` to output that file into a more rwadable format
5. `hr_output_ol.txt` now contains a readable description of the list, sorted by (1. author, 2. rating, 3. title)
